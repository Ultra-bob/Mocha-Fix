# Mocha
is a small, simple, tree-based operating system!  
Eventually it will have support for many more things, but right now it's just this.  
## Using a Command
Mocha is based on a tree, and each file has a parent and may have children.  
To start, enter the command `00` into the terminal.  
This will bring up the help menu, and teach you how to use it.  
The command is always the first character, and in this case is the "help" command.  
The second character is a parameter for the command, and in the help command's case,  
specifies what it will show you.  
For some commands, such as the help command, the second character is optional,  
but for other commands, such as the move command, it is required.
## Traversal and Usage of the Tree
Unlike other operating systems, folders do not exist in Mocha.  
Instead, we use "null files", or files that don't contain anything and take up little space.  
This means that you can have a text file be a parent of another file, and still act like a text file.  
All trees have a root file, which is null. Its only purpose is to connect all the branches.  
Under the "root" file you have total control - you have full privileges to edit, create, and delete.
