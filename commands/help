Commands / Help List
Brings up a list of all commands, or if you have a parameter at character 2, explains that command
Example: `02` would return an in-depth explanation of the second command, or the "check children" command.

Check Branch
Shows your current branch, and all ancestors of that branch.
Example: `1` could return   
1: root
2: files
3: thisFile.txt

Check Children
Shows a list of all children of your current branch.
Example: `2` could return
1: childOne.txt
2: child
3: test.py

Move / Teleport
Allows you to move up or down the tree.
The second char will either be `1` or `u` for up and `2` or `d` for down.
If you are moving down, you need to choose the child you move to. This can be done by adding the index of the child you want to move to at the end. You can find the index of a child using the "Check Children" command, or 2.
Example: `3d2` would move you to the second child of the branch

Properties
Allows you to check the properties of the file at your current location.
Example: `4` could give you
Name: "thisFile"
File Type: txt (Text File)
